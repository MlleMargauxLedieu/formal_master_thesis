\begin{abstract}
In the past few years, the use of machine learning in petroleum studies has risen. Especially for seismic interpretation and signal processing. But the use remains shy in carbonates classification and image analysis. This study aims at applying Deep Learning on reservoir rock images to produce an image classification algorithm. The images used are thin section of core rocks gathered while drilling exploration wells. The purpose is to classify thin sections according to their level of porosity, the Dunham and \gls{drt} classifications, and to be able to identify the different components they contain and. 
This study aims to classify carbonate facies according to the Dunham
classification scheme in high-resolution core images using machine learning techniques. The study
evaluates two commonly used machine learning algorithms, Random Forest (RF) and Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs), to identify facies in high-resolution carbonate core images through a number
of methods. CNNs were ascertained as the superior algorithm, achieving 89.2% accuracy for
identification of Mudstone to Rudstone and Crystalline Dolomite and producing results which were
sensible from a geological point of view. The main misclassification was between matrix and grain
supported facies, and fine and coarse grained facies, adjacent in the Dunham scheme. A survey of
the algorithm’s commonly misclassified images was conducted with geologists who had carbonate
classification experience. Experienced geologists attained an accuracy almost 20% greater than the
algorithm, with the same misclassification bias observed in both the geologists and the algorithm. A
Turing Test was carried out to verify whether the algorithm could pass for a geologist and the algorithm
went on to pass the test. The results of this study show great potential for the use of machine
learning in carbonate core classification in a fast and high-resolution manner, with a level of accuracy
approaching experienced geologists.
 The purpose is
to design an image recognition algorithm that is able to differentiate between tumors
and normal tissue in lungs. The algorithm is based on artificial neural networks and
therefore the ability of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict a tumor is
studied. Two different architectures are designed in this thesis, which are a three and
six layer CNN. In addition, different hyper-parameters and optimizers are compared in
order to find suitable settings.
This thesis concludes that no significant difference exists between the results of the
two architectures. The architecture with three layers is faster to train and therefore
100 trainings with same settings are completed with this architecture in order
to get statistics of the trainings. The mean accuracy for the test set is 91.1% and the
standard-deviation for the test set is 2.39%. The mean sensitivity is 89.7% and the
mean specificity is 92.4%.
